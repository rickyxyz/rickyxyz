 <summary><h3>🙍‍♂️ More about me</h3></summary>
  Wow, it's surprising that someone is actually reading this 😲.<br/>
  Well, hello! I'm Ricky, a CS graduate working in frontend development. One thing that might stand out about my profile is the how my job and interests does not align well. Why do I work in the frontend when my interests lean more towards something like DevOps? That's because of how I created my learning plan, currently my learning plan looks like this:
  <ol>
    <li>Learn frontend (📍 currently, I'm here)</li>
    <li>Learn backend</li>
    <li>Learn system administration</li>
    <li>Learn CI/CD and DevOps</li>
  </ol>
  So, why do I begin with the frontend? The reason is quite simple. No matter how optimized or beautiful your backend is, if the part that interacts with humans (the frontend) isn't good or usable, nobody would use your software (or at least love to use your software).
